# 25-100-Python-US_map_and_Chinese_map

This is 25/100 days of coding: the Complex Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022. 
We made an interactive US map and a Chinese map to help people learn about all the states and provinces.
By entering the name of states/provinces, it would locate itself on the map. 
The counts of correct guessing are going to be displayed on the title of the tab.
In the end, the program will generate a CSV file including the missing states/provinces for you to review.
Take the challenge!
